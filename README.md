Getting Official Maintainership for ShapeShiftOS
==========================================
>> To get Official Maintainership for ShapeShiftOS you should have a stable device source with all the main components working. Read the [**charter**](https://github.com/ShapeShiftOS/Shift_Documentation/blob/slave/Charter.mkdn) to get a clearer idea.

>> First make an unofficial build of ShapeShiftOS and post in [**XDA**](https://xda-developers.com) if you want to. Make sure you use the template here! Click on the raw button and change the links up where ever required.

>> Then, read [**here**](https://github.com/ShapeShiftOS/ShapeShift_Documents/blob/slave/Official.mkdn)

>> Join our [**Telegram Channel**](https://t.me/shapeshiftoschannel) and our  [**Telegram group**](https://t.me/shapeshiftos)

>> To publish builds use our Template : [**ShapeShiftOS XDA Template**](https://github.com/ShapeShiftOS/Shift_Documentation/blob/slave/Template.txt)
